## üìö Notebooks Overview

### Handling Missing Values

- **Arbitrary_Value_Imputation.ipynb**  
  This notebook demonstrates a method for handling missing values by imputing them with arbitrary values. This approach is commonly used when a more complex imputation technique is not suitable or necessary for the dataset at hand.

- **Mean_Median_Mode_Imputation.ipynb**  
  This notebook explores the use of mean, median, and mode imputation techniques. These methods are some of the most widely used strategies for filling missing values in numerical datasets, based on the central tendency of the data.

- **Random_sample_Imputation.ipynb**  
  This notebook covers the technique of random sample imputation, where missing values are replaced by randomly chosen values from the observed data. This method aims to preserve the overall distribution of the dataset.

- **Start_End_Of_Distribution_Imputation.ipynb**  
  This notebook introduces a technique for imputing missing values at the start or end of a data distribution. This method is particularly useful when dealing with edge cases or outliers in the data.

- **Handling_categorical_missing_data.ipynb**  
  This notebook provides strategies for handling missing categorical data. It includes methods such as replacing missing values with the most frequent category, performing mode imputation, and introducing a new category for missing values.

- **Missing_Values.ipynb**  
  This introductory notebook explains the different types of missing data: MCAR (Missing Completely at Random), MAR (Missing at Random), and MNAR (Missing Not at Random). Understanding the nature of missing data is critical for selecting the appropriate imputation method.

### Working with Datasets

- **Kaggle_Dataset.ipynb**  
  This notebook demonstrates how to download datasets directly from Kaggle into Google Colab. It simplifies the process of accessing and working with external datasets for data analysis.

### Data Manipulation and Analysis

- **Numpy.ipynb**  
  This notebook provides an introduction to working with NumPy arrays. It covers a range of topics, including array creation, indexing, slicing, and performing statistical operations such as mean, median, and standard deviation. It also discusses the reshaping and sorting of arrays and how to remove elements from an array.

- **Pandas.ipynb**  
  This notebook focuses on using Pandas for data manipulation. It covers the creation of Pandas Series and DataFrames, reading various data formats, and performing data cleaning tasks such as removing or replacing missing values, handling duplicates, and transforming the data for analysis.

### Data Visualization

- **MatplotlibSeaborn.ipynb**  
  This notebook provides an in-depth guide to visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn. It demonstrates how to create a variety of plots, including scatter plots, line plots, bar charts, histograms, box plots, and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) plots, all of which are essential for exploring and presenting data insights.
